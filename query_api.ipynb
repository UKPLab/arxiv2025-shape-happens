    "# prompt = \"\"\"Generate a sentence based on the given taxonomy of temporal expression. The sentence should be categorized according to the following criteria:  \n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **1. Type (Core TimeX2 Taxonomy)**  \n",
    "# This defines the kind of temporal expression used in the sentence. It falls into one of the following categories:  \n",
    "\n",
    "# #### **1.1 Precise Time Expressions**  \n",
    "# These refer to specific points in time with absolute specificity. They include:  \n",
    "# - **Date:** A calendar date (e.g., *\"She was born on October 12, 1998.\"*).  \n",
    "# - **Time of day:** A specific time in a day (e.g., *\"The meeting starts at 9 AM.\"*).  \n",
    "# - **Duration:** A span of time indicating how long something lasts (e.g., *\"The war lasted from 1939 to 1945.\"*, *\"The meeting is from 9 AM to 5 PM.\"*).  \n",
    "\n",
    "# #### **1.2 Fuzzy Time Expressions**  \n",
    "# These refer to a generic or imprecise point in time. The exact value is subjective, relative, or undefined. They include:  \n",
    "# - **Indeterminate date:** An event happening within an interval (e.g. week, weekend, quarter, season), for which it isn't possible to determine a precise date (e.g., *\"I'll visit next Wednesday.\"*, *\"Last weekend, I practiced piano.\"*).  \n",
    "# - **Indeterminate duration:** A duration without a clear endpoint, categorized as past, present, or future (e.g., *\"He has been traveling lately.\"*, *\"In the future, I'd like to learn how to paint.\"*).  \n",
    "# - **Indeterminate time of day:** Reference to a time of day to which it's impossible to assign a precise value (e.g., *\"I'll see you tonight.\"*, *\"We went shopping this morning.\"*).  \n",
    "# - **Unspecified duration:** A duration is given, but its length is ambiguous (e.g., *\"The party went on for hours.\"*).  \n",
    "\n",
    "# #### **1.3 Set of Times**  \n",
    "# A reference to multiple disjoint time points, which may or may not be periodic:  \n",
    "# - **Periodic:** An event recurring with a well-defined frequency (e.g., *\"He goes jogging every Friday.\"*).  \n",
    "# - **Non-periodic:** A disjoint set of references which are non-repeating (e.g., *\"I've visited Rome a few times.\"*).  \n",
    "\n",
    "# #### **1.4 Confounder**  \n",
    "# A misleading use of numbers or dates that might be mistaken for a time expression (e.g., *\"The name of the pub is 'October 1969'.\"*, *\"There have been 1988 attempts to colonize Mars.\"*).  \n",
    "\n",
    "# #### **1.5 Time-Independent**  \n",
    "# A sentence without any temporal expression. For example, plain statements or scientific facts (e.g., *\"Water boils at 100°C.\"*, *\"the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees\"*, *\"The Italian flag is composed of three colors.\"*).  \n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **2. Anchoring (Also TimeX2)**  \n",
    "# Defines whether a time expression is explicitly linked to another time-related reference in the same sentence:  \n",
    "# - **Date:** A temporal reference tied to another time expression (e.g., *\"The course lasts three months. After that, you'll be fluent.\"*).  \n",
    "# - **Event:** A temporal reference tied to an event (e.g., *\"Three years after the war ended, Italy was still recovering.\"*).  \n",
    "# - **None:** No explicit connection to another temporal reference.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **3. Notability**  \n",
    "# Indicates whether the event referenced is notable enough to infer a timeframe:  \n",
    "# - **Yes:** A significant historical or well-known event (e.g., *\"My grandfather fought in World War II.\"*).  \n",
    "# - **No:** A non-notable event with no global or historical importance (e.g., *\"I went to the park last summer.\"*).  \n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **4. Tense**  \n",
    "# Determines the nature of the event:\n",
    "# - **Past:** The event happened in the past and is concluded (e.g., *\"She graduated in 2010.\"*).  \n",
    "# - **Present:** The event is happening now (e.g., *\"He is currently writing a book.\"*).  \n",
    "# - **Future:** The event will happen at some point later (e.g., *\"They will meet next Monday.\"*).  \n",
